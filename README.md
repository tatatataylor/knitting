## Invisible bind off for 2x2 ribbing in the round
*this is exclusively for 2x2 ribbing! go somewhere else if knitting 1x1 or stockinette* 

Sourced from [this tutorial] (https://nurtureknitwear.com/bind-off-kitchener-stitch-for-2x2-ribbing/)
This is also a bad tutorial and I could be doing it all wrong whoops

### Set up
1. Work ribbing until the next two stitches are a pair of knit stitches.
2. Cut your  yarn, leaving a long yarn tail, at least three times the width of your knitting, plus an additional 6 inches for weaving.
3. Thread the yarn onto a tapestry needle.
4. Lock a stitch marker around the back leg of the first and third stitches.

### Working the bind off
1. First, insert your tapestry needle knitwise into the first knit stitch and slide the stitch off your knitting needle onto your tapestry needle.
2. Insert your tapestry needle into the next knit stitch purlwise and leave it on your knitting needle. Pull your yarn all the way through, ensuring the yarn is behind your needles.
3. Skipping the knit stitch on your knitting needle, go behind your work, and insert your tapestry needle into the first purl stitch purlwise from the back of the work to the front.
4. Insert your tapestry needle into the second purl stitch knitwise. Pull your yarn through, keeping your yarn behind your needles.
5. Insert your tapestry needle knitwise into the first knit stitch on your knitting needles. Slide the first knit stitch and the first purl stitch off your knitting needle.
6. Keep the tapestry needle in front of your work, insert the tapestry needle purlwise into the next knit stitch. Pull your yarn through, keeping it in front of your work.
7. Insert your tapestry needle purlwise the first purl stitch on your knitting needle, and slip purl stitch off the needle *(added this last part so I'm not actually sure if it's correct)*
8. Place your tapestry needle behind the next 2 knit stitches and then insert your needle knitwise into the next purl stitch. Pull your yarn through, keeping it behind your work.

Repeat the 8 steps above until you have **4 stitches left**, beginning with a pair of knit stitches. Then work Steps 1-4 one additional time. You will now have **3 sts–1 knit followed by 2 purls**–on your needles.

### Finishing the bind off
Slide all three stitches onto your tapestry needle purlwise–DO NOT slide off the needle and onto the yarn. Open the interlocking stitch marker and place the purl and knit stitch on your stitch marker back on your knitting needle. Transfer all 3 stitches on the tapestry needle back to the knitting needle.
